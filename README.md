# Carto StaticMap Examples

Simple web project that allows anybody to test Carto's StaticMap API interactively.

*Basemaps*, *examples* and *options* (such as the longitude, latitude, zoom...) can be configured and tested quickly without having to reload the website.

The result image and code can be viewed and saved within the interface.

An online version of this project can be found [here](https://pmarfany.github.io/carto-static-maps-example).
